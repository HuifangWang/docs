.. Abstract

Brain function is thought to emerge from the interactions of large numbers of neurons. Apart from the traditional efforts to reproduce brain dynamics from the micro- to macroscopic level, complementary approaches develop abstract models of lower complexity. Such macroscopic models typically generate only a few selected – ideally functionally relevant – aspects of the brain dynamics. Importantly, they often allow an understanding of the underlying mechanisms beyond just computational reproduction. Adding detail to these models will widen its ability to reproduce a broader range of dynamic features of the brain. For instance, such models allow for the exploration of the consequences of pathological changes in the system, enabling us to identify and potentially counteract those unfavourable processes. Towards this end, The Virtual Brain has been developed - a neuroinformatics platform with a brain simulator at its core - enabling the model-based inference of neurophysiological mechanisms on different brain scales that underlie the generation of macroscopic neuroimaging signals.
