Realistic connectivity
----------------------

.. long-range and local connectivity

.. In the framework of |TVB| we incorporate biologically realistic large scale coupling of neural populations at salient brain regions that is mediated by long-range neural fibre tracts as identified with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) based tractography together with mean-field models as local node models.
