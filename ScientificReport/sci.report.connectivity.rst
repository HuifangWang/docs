Realistic connectivity
----------------------

.. long-range and local connectivity

Long Range Connectivity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the framework of |TVB| we incorporate biologically realistic large scale 
connectivity of neural populations at salient brain regions that is mediated 
by long-range neural fibre tracts as identified with diffusion spectrum imaging 
(DSI) and white-matter tractography based methods. (`Knock et al 2009`_)

.. large scale connectivity things should come here

Local Connectivity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. surfaces stuff should come here
