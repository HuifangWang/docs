Multi-scale dynamics

.. models


This choice is motivated by various reasons (see scientific documentation), 
but foremost by the fact that a wide range of neuron models can be described by 
the a 2D dynamic system and that () have shown that population models of 
such neuron models preserve the mathematical form of the single neuron equations. 
2D generic oscillator models generate a wide range of phenomena as observed in 
neuronal population dynamics such as multistability, coexistence of oscillatory 
and non-oscillatory behaviors, various behaviors displaying multiple time scales, 
to name just a few.
