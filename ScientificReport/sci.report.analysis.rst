Analysis of large-scale brain dynamics
======================================

.. metrics/validation of the results/data processing maybe? 

Time-series metrics
-------------------


.. tip::
  
  Maybe Jean Luc might provide some information about the time-series metrics 
  that are used for parameters space exploration?



Structural Equation Modeling
----------------------------

.. tip::

  Since Structural Equation Modeling is a statistical technique we might 
  consider adding Randy McIntosh contributions in this section.
