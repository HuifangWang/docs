Brain Connectivity Toolbox Analyzers
....................................

If you have `matlab` or `octave` installed and available through the command line
then all the algorithms offered by `Brain Connectivity Toolbox` can be used directly
from |TVB| interface and the results can later be displayed in one of our visualizers.
