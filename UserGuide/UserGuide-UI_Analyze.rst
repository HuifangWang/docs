   Current available analyzers


TVB analyzers
.............

The techniques currently offered as part of |TVB| are:

    - Continuous Wavelet Transform
    - Fast Fourier Transform
    - Cross Coherence of Nodes
    - Principal Component Analysis
    - Independent Component Analysis
    - Cross Correlation of Nodes
    - Time-series metrics
    - Temporal Covariance of Nodes


Brain Connectivity Toolbox Analyzers
....................................

If you have `matlab` or `octave` installed and available through the command 
line then all the algorithms offered by `Brain Connectivity Toolbox` (BCT) 
can be used directly from |TVB| interface and the results can later be displayed
in one of our visualizers.

Additional BCT techniques are:

    - Degree and Similarity Algorithms
    - Centrality Algorithms
    - Distance Algorithms
    - Modularity Algorithms
    - Clustering Algorithms
    - Density Algorithms
